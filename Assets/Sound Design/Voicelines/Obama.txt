Erik, we have a very important mission for you.
This operation is flagged with confidential level 5. Only you, me and your commander know about what is about to happen.
Satellites show irregular behavior around a forest in Bolivia. Intelligence suggest the Chinese might be working on a new kind of weapon.
Of course, this sounds like a threat itself, but this mission is of top priority because of something else.
The Chinese, they...
They are transporting turtles to their base. And not just a few. We believe those turtles are used for their new weapon.
Please, Erik.
Save those turtles.
