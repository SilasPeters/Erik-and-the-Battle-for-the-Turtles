Heads up Erik. Multiple hostiles have been spotted near the entrance of that Chinese base. Take them out first.

Good job Erik. Now, we did not bring any hacking tools. That damned intern forgot how important this mission is. For now, if something holds you back, just shoot it.

Excellent. According to our intel you should be approaching a big-ass door. Find the code.

Now we might lose signal when you are further in. Be carefull out there.

Okay Erik, you will now need to absolutely watch you step. Many hostiles [distorted:] should be [inaudible:] awaiting you in the next room.

[Power outage: entrance door opens]

Erik? Erik!? Are you OK? Things are happening, leave the building ASAP.
